## Latest Update
- 12/08/2023 I am working to add different materials such as Sand, Water, Bricks, and Air. My goal at the moment is to continue to ensure that the materials interact with eachother properly. 

## Old Updates

- 12/07/2023 I am currently working on setting up the project. Since this is my first time working with SFML, I want to spend time familiarizing myself with the library.
Next steps include organizing the game loop, abstracting into different files, and adding support for different types of materials.

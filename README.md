Sandbox Style SFML Application

## Running the Program
Either double click `prog` or navigate to the folder where `prog` is using terminal and run `./prog`

## Latest Update
I am currently working on setting up the project. Since this is my first time working with SFML, I want to spend time familiarizing myself with the library.
Next steps include organizing the game loop, abstracting into different files, and adding support for different types of materials.
